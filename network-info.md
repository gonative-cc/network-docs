# Network Info

## Testnet-1

### Become a validator

- Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gonative), ask moderators to get you in the testnet channel.
- Using Discord, send to admins your validator address and valoper address and ping admins to send you testnet NTIV.
- Once your node validator is set up (and you did self delegation), ping admins again with your valoper address. We will do a delegation.
